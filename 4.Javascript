                JavaScript is considered an interpreted language because its code is executed line by line by the JavaScript engine, 
                typically embedded in web browsers or other environments like Node.js. Unlike compiled languages such as C++ or Java, 
                which require a separate compilation step to convert source code into machine code before execution, JavaScript is 
                executed directly from the source code.

                This process allows JavaScript to be dynamically executed at runtime, enabling features like just-in-time (JIT) 
                compilation and dynamic typing. The JavaScript engine, like V8 (used in Google Chrome and Node.js), can optimize 
                the execution of the code on the fly, but the code is still interpreted in the sense that it is run directly 
                from the written script without needing a prior compilation step.
